I started this\r\nin order to follow a great [tutorial](https://github.com/filipedeschamps/rss-feed-emitter/issues/119) by \r\n[filipedeschamps](https://github.com/filipedeschamps/) on creating a JavaScript module from scratch in ES6, creating unit\r\ntests which are automated using [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and are also used to generate a code coverage report \r\nusing [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Simple interface\r\n* Written in ES6!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nMight put this on npm soon...\r\n\r\n### Creating an instance\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet RoughTime = require('rough-time');\r\nlet roughtime = new RoughTime();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Getting the rough time\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet approxTimeString = roughtime.getRoughTime(new Date());\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example output\r\n`02:12` or `14:12` > `it is ten past two`\r\n\r\n`11:46` or `23:46` > `it is quarter to twelve`\r\n\r\n`03:01` or `15:01` > `it is three o'clock` etc.",
